# PC_Build_3

This build was a rebuild of a Dell XPS PC from 2018 that had served as our primary work PC for over 5 years.

It had reached a point where the CPU and GPU fans were ALWAYS revving so I knew heat was becoming an issue. My solutions were to swap the case and reapply thermal paste to both the CPU and GPU.

In order to swap the case, the motherboard and powersupply had to be replaced, but it was well worth it. 

This thing runs super quiet without any revving now (and it's PINK(!) for my wife and daughter!)
